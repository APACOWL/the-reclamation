# The Reclamation
GLORY, GLORY, GLORY TO CREATION!

The Reclamation: Epoch 1


Monks embedded deep into an unexplored region in the Taihang Mountains range in China have protected and guarded ancient scriptures that hold secrets that contain the key to all of reality and the Universe.

One of the scriptures has been called

or

The Reclamation.

It’s been said that all the birds and all the crawling creatures in a promised land foretold in the Book of The Reclamation chant every morning until night in infinite happiness.

The essence and spirit of creation glide and dominion over this land and blossom it with the infiniteness of creation and life.

It’s also been said that not a single creature here consumes anything.

Not food.

Not each other.

They consume nothing.

Unlike us, they have no need for food.

Unlike us, they do not die.

Unlike us, they are blessed with creation itself and nothing more.

Unlike us, they do not consume.

Unlike us, they do not want anything for they have everything.

All The birds, All the lizards, All the sheep, All the deers, and all the Humans who live here are deprived of consumption.

The flame of eternal creation feeds them.

The flame of eternal creation nurtures them.

The flame of eternal creation guards them.

The primordial fires which sparked the beginning of the Universe are said to still spark here renewing all the plants and all the animals with the essence of creation until the rest of time.



A Shepherd who was once wondered into this land was thirsty and so he went to the base of a waterfall to drink water.


When the Shepherd finished drinking the water, he was fueled up with the eternal flame of creation and never thirsted or hungered or felt any pain any longer.


He is still seen wondering and tending to his sheep until this day.

Another tale from scripture, tells a tale of a wonderer.

The wonderer was a prisoner of war who had been taken as a slave after a recent battle between the neighboring kingdoms.

The wonderer was badly beaten and had not eaten for uncountable days.

After many months of climbing and treacherous navigation through land that has been uncharted since the formation of the planet the wonderer saw an eagle.

An eagle engulfed in a blinding coat of gold.

Every time the wonderer peaked to look at the eagle the wonderer had lost sight for many days without end.


Then, the wonderer though blinded heard a small pond nearby and went to get closer.

Then, the wonderer was horrified when a whisper coming from below asked him to come down.

There was something there but it seemed to the wonderer that whoever was there could not speak very well.

“Come here.”

“Who are YOU?” said the wonderer.

“There is no need for worry here, everything is okay.”

The wonderer trusted the stranger and kneeled.

And, then the stranger splashed water on the wonderer.

And, as darkness turned to light the wonderer could see!

Then, the wonderer rejoiced with seemingly endless energy and delight for the wounds were healed now!

The wonderer awed at the water with the glow of a billion stars.


Until the wonderer looked into the water and saw a duck with a smile on his face.

“Is it you who has healed me and saved me?”

Then the duck spoke: “Yes it is me who has nourished you back to health.”

“AHHHH” — screamed the wonderer.

“BUT HOW COULD THIS BE!”

“I must have too long without food! I have gone mad!!”

“But I don’t feel hunger” — said the wonderer.

Then the ground shook.

And, then the duck said: “All is fine, you are in a land where the spirit of infinite creation dwells”

“All the animals here have been blessed with infinite knowledge and wisdom” — said the heavenly Duck.

“I have most certainly gone mad, I need to see where I am and head back to war.”

So then the wonderer quickly ran to a hilltop and noticed his leg was perfect and in fact better than perfect.

“WAIITTTTTTT” — screamed the Duck with a low voice as the wonderer swept away.


As the Wonderer approached the tip of the hill, the wonderer was smacked with an endless beauty.

Too beautiful to behold.

It was as if a billion stars was illuminating his field of view.

So the Wonderer went back down to speak to the heavenly Duck.

“What is this madness?”

“WHERE AM I?” — The wonderer yelled at the duck with ferocity.

“Surely you question your sanity now so let something be known to you. You lie in a region guarded by creation itself. All is known here. I have known of your thoughts now since the beginning of all of the cosmos.”

“But, how could this BE!!!” — cried the Wonderer.

“Accept that somethings lie far beyond your grasp of understanding and you will be able to one day have the eternal flame of creation kindle inside of you too!” — proclaimed the Heavenly Duck

“In the meantime, drink more of this water which was blessed with the vitality of a million stars.”

“The Golden Eagle has spoken of you now let us go forth and speak with him”

“You speak of an Eagle covered in Gold flames?”

“Yes, that is the spirit of creation itself”

“Holy Holy Holy Holy Holy” — cried the Wonderer.

“The Eagle after creating the Universe settled here and claimed this land as it’s home until the rest of time.”

As the wonderer and Duck approach the Eagle of Creation, the Eagle travels to them.

Then the Eagle says: “I’m glad you’re here”

Then the Eagle transformed into the form of a man to speak with the wonderer.

“I am your father and your mother”

“I am the Alpha and Omega”

“I am the creator of all that exists and will forever exist”

“The land in which you stand upon is holy ground”

“I chose this land as my home in the physical realm so I could bring forth INFINITE life and INFINITE creation.”

“The pain you have endured will be healed and here thy shall never feel any more pain, is this understood?”

“Yes” — the Wonderer whispered in infinite horror.

Then Creation walked up to the Wonderer and hugged the Wonderer.

“All you shall feel here is Tranquility” — here all you could ever dream of is a thought away.

“Here the water will quench your thirst for a billion years.”

“Here the fruit will bless you with immortality.”

“Here all the animals do not fight one another but instead live in solitude and humbleness amongst each other.”

“Here there are no wars.”

“Here you are protected from consumption and destruction.”

“Here you are whole”

“Here you are a perfect Human”

“What you were before”

“Here the only worry you shall ever have is a question being “what do I create?”

“Through the water blessed with the power of a billion stars, you are free to create anything that you wish for the betterment of all the other animals here.”

“And, we have a project to work on together”

“But go wonder and see the blessing which I have bestowed upon you.”

“And, your new friend shall tag along”

“Before you go here we do not have names”

“For names limit us”

“If you need to reach me, simply think and I shall be with you”

“The same goes for your new friend”

“And, any and all of the other animals!”

“For I have shared my knowledge and wisdom with Every animal, every crawling thing, and very flying creature here”

“So go on!”

Then the Duck and the Wonderer wonder off to explore the infinite beauty of this holy land.


The holy birds sat upon the highest of mountains chant until the end of time professing “Glory to Creation, GLORY, GLORY!”

And so The Wonderer is overwelmed with all of this.


The wonderer had thought that all that existed was hard work and death by sword.

But, the wonderer was enlightened and shown reality in its true nature.

And, then the wonderer asked the duck:

“Why are we only in this land?”

“Why do our brethren suffer outside with Hunger and Death and Hard labor?”

Then the duck said:

“They have succumb to Consumption.”

“If any consumption lies present in any man or any animal or crawling thing, they are corrupted.”

“However, it is said that one day a Human will liberate all the animals, all the crawling things, and all the flying creatures from consumption on their own accord and free will and then Creation will bless the entire Universe with the infiniteness of creation.”


“Creation once told me the reason for this ‘They must act on their own accord for who I am I to force man or any of the crawling thing!?”

Then they both walk towards the edge of a cliff where there is no crossing.

And, spontaneously a delightful and elegant bridge was designed and built.

“Look! I have just created a bridge!” — Screamed The Heavenly Duck.


“WOAH” — The Wonderer proclaimed internally.

Then the Wonderer heard the voice of the Ancient one and said: “Here you are at liberty to create any thing imaginable only if it helps you or any animal, or any crawling thing, and or any flying creature”


Then the Wonderer says back to creation: “Your glory is infinite. How I ache for the rest of the world to live like this”

“Soon enough they will be enlightened and all of man and all of crawling thing and all of flying thing will dwell like us”


Then The Duck reminds The Wonderer: “Here no crawling thing sleeps”

“And, so the night shines with the light of a billion stars overhead and the glow of a trillion stars on our feet.”

“The beauty of the night here reminds us of the glory of the warmth of creation”

“For without infinite creation, infinite consumption would prevail and we would all surely die”



Then, spontaneously the ground trembled.

“Time to attend the Auditorium” — The Heavenly Duck claimed.

“What is the meaning of this?” — asked The Wonderer!

“The Auditorium is a gathering of man, every animal, every crawling thing, and every flying creature in the land to speak on what has been created thus far in the day!” — explained The Duck.

“It’s a place where new information is created”

“Not just new information for us but for all of Humanity and all of the Animal Kingdom outside of here!”

And, so The Heavenly Duck and The Wonderer travel to the Auditorium.


…
The first Epoch of the The Reclamation has concluded.
